**Project Title:** Q.W.A.C.K. Sun and Cloud Animation Assignment

**Project Owner:** Saketh Kasyap

**Project Overview:**
The Q.W.A.C.K. Sun and Cloud Animation Assignment aims to create an animated scene representing a sunrise with clouds floating across the sky. The assignment is part of Saketh Kasyap's coursework, designed to enhance front-end web development skills and create an interactive visual experience.

**Project Objectives:**

1. Develop an animated sunrise effect using HTML and CSS.
2. Implement cloud animations to simulate clouds moving across the sky.
3. Ensure the animation is visually appealing and aligns with assignment requirements.
4. Optimize the code for performance and compatibility across different web browsers.
5. Document the project for submission and evaluation.

**Project Components:**

1. HTML file: Contains the structure of the webpage.
2. CSS file: Defines the styles and animations for the sunrise and clouds.
3. JavaScript (optional): May be used for additional interactivity or advanced animations (not utilized in this project).

**Implementation Details:**

1. **HTML Structure:**

   - The HTML file consists of a `<div>` element with the class "sunrise" as the container for the sunrise animation.
   - Within the "sunrise" div, there is another `<div>` element with the class "sun" representing the sun.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - The CSS file defines styles for the sunrise, sun, and clouds.
   - The sunrise animation (`rise`) is implemented using keyframes to move the sun from the bottom of the viewport to the middle.
   - Clouds are styled with appropriate shapes and colors to resemble realistic cloud formations.
   - Cloud animations (`moveClouds`) move the clouds horizontally across the screen in a continuous loop.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Clone or download the project files from the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the animation.
3. Customize the animation parameters (e.g., sun size, cloud positions) by modifying the CSS code as needed.
4. Experiment with additional features or interactivity using JavaScript if desired.

**Project Dependencies:**

- None. This project relies solely on HTML and CSS for implementation.

**Project Future Enhancements:**

1. Add more elements to the animation scene, such as birds or other objects.
2. Implement responsive design to ensure the animation adapts to different screen sizes.
3. Explore advanced CSS techniques for more complex animations and visual effects.
4. Integrate the animation into a personal website or portfolio for display.

**Project Notes:**

- The assignment was completed as part of coursework and meets the specified requirements.
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
